</div><div class='post-excerptable'>It’s colder here like you wanted (but still, not by much). The thrift store in the visitor’s center has been
closed since five. A plastic flamingo (<span class='tcrm-1095'>$</span>19.50 from Walmart, incl. tax, for a two-pack) (I wore one on
my head for Halloween this year) stands on the ice machine. Somebody sits between us with the hair
of an old friend – they catch me looking but really I’m just searching for the sibling. My drink is the
Bittersweet Symphony, named for a song that’s followed us (more me than you) since I was seventeen. It
was dark when I arrived and is darker when I leave. I stand at the curb and motion the old man to
drive on ahead – he parodies the gesture but you know I don’t trust like that. Seven miles up, a bar
with twenty-four open seats. Stock photos of cocktails (three per) splashing in their glasses against a
black void. Inexplicably, The Beatles too. The bartender says sorry like you imagine a Canadian might.
A man tells me he’s writing a novel about his cats and it’s making him so happy. You ask me what
it’s like to not be such a hometown guy, and we laugh but you were always crueler than you let on.
