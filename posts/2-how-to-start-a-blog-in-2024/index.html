</div>
<div class='post-excerptable'>The internet has been steeped for years in a sort of technological disillusionment – particularly when it comes to
written social media. Short-to-medium-form text-based posting sites – Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, a few
mainstream derivatives and imitators – are seen as centralized and impersonal, as engagement factories
overrun with the same posts quoted, copied, or stolen from each other ad nauseam. This is contrasted in
large part with a nostalgic view of the “old internet,” a space dominated by individually-run websites,
usually handwritten HTML hosted by free or low-cost providers like Angelfire or GeoCities. Although I’m
condensing a lot of history here – we don’t have time to get into the ways sites like BlogSpot, Facebook, and
LiveJournal appeared before becoming the various ghost towns and fascist hellscapes they are today, nor
are we really concerned with litigating the division between the so-called “Web 1.0” and “Web 2.0.”
</div>
<!-- l. 33 --><p class='noindent'>Likewise, reasons for this disillusionment are to an extent self-evident, and even if you aren’t an active user of any of
these websites, you probably have a good intuition for what they’re like. Content is monetized to the fullest extent
permitted by the platform, or simply serves to direct an audience towards other, more profitable platforms. This
monetization scheme is based on “engagement,” a metric indifferent to artistry, sincerity, and factual correctness while
favoring disinformation, controversial or outrageous takes, unoriginality, and low-effort spam. Maybe I’m wrong, but I
feel like everyone more-or-less understands this. The obstacles to reverting to a Web 1.0 paradigm of
low-tech, handcrafted blogs are equally predictable – such blogs require somewhat more technical knowledge
and a significant time investment to create, may require fees to host, and, perhaps most importantly,
will be entirely bereft of readers unless promoted on the same social media sites one was hoping to
escape.
</p><!-- l. 35 --><p class='noindent'>In 2021, I started taking Adderall to treat my ADHD – as anyone in the same circumstance knows, pharmacies in the
US have been experiencing a shortage of that and similar medications. I was still living in Albuquerque at the time,
where the difficulties obtaining my medication were consistent but manageable. As a Schedule II stimulant,
amphetamine can be prescribed only in a quantity of up to thirty capsules, once every thirty days. This is an
unforgiving system even when it works, as any delay in communication between you and your doctor will result in
delays filling the prescription, which invariably result in days which your medication will be missed. Since 2022, most
pharmacies would have no inventory of the medication at the time I needed a refill, so I would spend
about a week without it before being able to fill it again. Thirty days on, seven days off, thirty days on,
etc.
</p><!-- l. 37 --><p class='noindent'>The first day off would usually be fine – slight headaches, trouble waking up, trouble sleeping. The second would be
worse – tremors, sweating, shivering, migraines, clear thoughts few and far between. The third would be the worst, but
everything would mostly balance out by the fourth. Restarting the medication, however, was always a little more
interesting. I take 25mg extended-release amphetamine salt capsules – not a high dose, per se, but significantly higher
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    
than the 5mg dose usually taken when one is just beginning. Without titrating up to the higher dose, the
first three days after restarting the medication would be unsustainably <span class='cmti-10x-x-109'>wonderful</span>. I barely slept and
barely ate because I didn’t need to. I could talk for hours during the day and, when alone at night,
would conceive, work on, and complete a new creative project. And, I think they were always, after some
revision with a clearer mind, good – or, at least, as good as anything else I was writing in my early
twenties.
</p><!-- l. 39 --><p class='noindent'>In New York, the system is worse – instead of getting a prescription from any physician, you have to
see a psychiatrist, usually not covered by your insurance, either in person or via telehealth, once every
thirty days. The pill shortage is dramatically worse as well – I had to wait about a year before I found a
pharmacy that had my medication in stock. And, as my appointment approached and I prepared to shell out
<span class='tcrm-1095'>$</span>350 to be told that I indeed do have the condition that I know I have, I began thinking about what to
write.
</p><!-- l. 41 --><p class='noindent'>The last long work I completed in such a way was never published (although I had intended to), only
circulated among some friends and colleagues. And I, like a lot of people, have always felt an intense
disinterest in producing “content” to be aggregated on some social media platform, but wanted that
feeling of having released something into the world. The obstacles, too, seemed surmountable: I had the
technical knowledge to do it, and a scheme by which I could do it for free; I was already planning on
compensating for a lack of free time with stimulants, and it’s not like I had an audience to lose to begin
with.
</p><!-- l. 43 --><p class='noindent'>From there, I had to establish some design goals and constraints – I could make the website, sure, but what should it
be like? First, posts should be static pages, and the whole site should avoid using JavaScript as much as possible. This
was perhaps overkill, but I have enough built-up resentment for the language that this was a very easy decision to
make. Second and relatedly, it should be entirely noninteractive. No comments sections, no guestbook, no sharing to
social media – not because I’m above all that but because I just want a space where I can write. Third, it wouldn’t be
enough to just write the code myself. It should be bespoke, a creation uniquely tailored to the way I write and the
work that I do, with all the inefficiencies and problems and inflexibility that come with that. It should be beautiful
and cumbersome.
</p><!-- l. 45 --><p class='noindent'>During daylight hours, I’m a mathematician, apparently. Accordingly, I do most of my writing in LaTeX, a typesetting
language better suited to writing mathematical expressions than any others widely in use. LaTeX is also, you know,
bad – it was created in the 1980s and remains slow, difficult to use, highly customizable while being singularly hard to
customize, the kind of software nobody would use on purpose. The original version of LaTeX compiles a <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>.tex </span>source
file to a <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>.dvi </span>output file, a format that nobody uses, while more modern versions include <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>pdflatex</span>, which produces
a <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>.pdf </span>output file. Incidentally, another program, <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>tex4ht</span>, can compile LaTeX to an HTML output
file.
</p><!-- l. 47 --><p class='noindent'>For the most part, the HTML produced by <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>tex4ht </span>is acceptable – it is clean and relatively uncomplicated and, in my
opinion, visually appealing. Actually using it, however, is characteristically unwieldy, and really requires some sort of
automation to be practical. So, another obstacle emerges – my laptop has two partitions, one running
Windows 10 and one running Linux. Historically, I’ve used the former for academic work and the latter
for anything more technical, usually just software development. Since starting grad school, I’ve been
predictably busy with schoolwork, so much so that I find myself rarely using the Linux installation.
Unfortunately, the only real experience I have automating build systems for software is on Linux, so I
—
</p><!-- l. 49 --><p class='noindent'>Let me cut myself off, for both our benefits – I’ll just pretend I’m using Linux and run my build system with WSL. A
third, minor obstacle is that I don’t have enough free storage space to have a second installation of LaTeX
inside of WSL, so my build system will have to call the Windows version of each LaTeX compilation
tool.
</p><!-- l. 51 --><p class='noindent'>The classical way to automate building software on Linux is <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>make</span>, a program that lets you define rules for turning
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    
source files (“prerequisites”) into output files (“targets”). First written in 1976, <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>make </span>is even older than LaTeX, and
has been superseded in most new projects by a multitude of replacements that are easier to use – but when has
that ever stopped me? Now, I make no claim to being any good at writing <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>Makefile</span>s, but want to see
it?

<!-- l. 74 --><p class='nopar'>
</p><!-- l. 76 --><p class='noindent'>Here’s the first part. There are packages for LaTeX specifically for formatting and highlighting code, all of which I
performatively chose not to use in favor of the builtin <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>verbatim </span>environment, which believes that whitespace should
no longer be whitespace. And, incidentally, <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>make </span>is so equally unfriendly that it demands indentation by tabs instead
of spaces, unless you set the <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>.RECIPEPREFIX </span>to a single space. Those quirks aside, this isn’t so bad – the <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>Makefile</span>
finds any <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>.tex </span>source file for a post, and for each one defines a rule that compiles it to a <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>.dvi </span>file, producing a <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>.bcf</span>
file which contains more bibliography information, then runs <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>make4ht </span>to create an HTML file as an output. And, for
the most part, it works.
</p><!-- l. 78 --><p class='noindent'>Unfortunately, I’m told there’s more to a blog than a collection of unindexed, disconnected, text-only webpages. The
second thing I tasked my <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>Makefile </span>with was to generate a homepage which could automatically list all the posts.
From the HTML file we generated for the post above, we needed to first extract the title, date, and an excerpt, and
then insert that item into a list on our homepage. Now, there’s a tool that’s been around since the 1970s that can do
this using regular expressions: <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>sed</span>. It works wonderfully for processing text one line at a time, but absolutely fails to
handle multi-line text conveniently. Now, I eventually learned that by saving our homepage list elements to a file, <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>sed</span>
could insert that file’s contents at a specific line in our homepage, which works fine. Here’s what it looks
like:

<!-- l. 95 --><p class='nopar'>
</p><!-- l. 97 --><p class='noindent'>A good solution? No, but that’s my whole thing. And, for all its mild acceptability, it took so much time for me to
learn what I needed to learn, in that kind of one-off sort of education where I will never remember the technique,
only that I have done it before. It was during this prolonged struggle with <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>sed </span>that I asked myself the
question – the same question you have been asking – why am I doing this? Why am I doing any of this?
Why am I making so many inconvenient, honestly bad choices, starting with this website itself and
then extending to my entire methodology and its whole implementation? Why would anyone do this on
purpose?
</p><!-- l. 99 --><p class='noindent'>First, I found this lightly-sourced axios.com listicle<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#fn1x0' id='fn1x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>1</sup></a></span><a id='x1-2f1'></a>,
describing the likely causes of the Adderall shortage as increased demand (partially due to telehealth prescriptions
during the pandemic) and DEA actions taken against both prescribers and manufacturers.
</p><!-- l. 101 --><p class='noindent'>Now, there’s a general consensus that demand for controlled stimulant medications has increased, but it’s
hard to say exactly by how much. In Massachusetts, for example, the CDC found the percentage of
sampled health insurance enrollees prescribed any stimulant increased from 3.6% to 4.1% between 2016 and
2021<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#fn2x0' id='fn2x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>2</sup></a></span><a id='x1-4f2'></a>, while a study
commissioned by the DOJ found that the number of stimulant prescriptions dispensed nationwide increased from 50.4 million in 2012
to 79.6 million in 2022.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#fn3x0' id='fn3x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>3</sup></a></span><a id='x1-6f3'></a>
This is all mildly interesting but essentially irrelevant – this increase in prescriptions has been gradual and
predictable and, importantly, does not in any way exceed the capacity of manufacturers to produce the
medication.
</p><!-- l. 103 --><p class='noindent'>More amusing are the legal actions taken against prescribers. The listicle links to a <span class='cmti-10x-x-109'>New York Times</span>
article<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#fn4x0' id='fn4x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>4</sup></a></span><a id='x1-8f4'></a>
discussing a telehealth firm, frustratingly named “Done, Inc.,” indicted in the Northern District of California for a
multitude of crimes, including “Conspiracy to Distribute Controlled Substances” and “Conspiracy to Commit Health Care
Fraud.”<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#fn5x0' id='fn5x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>5</sup></a></span><a id='x1-10f5'></a>
The folktale version of this is that during the pandemic, it became easier by regulations to prescribe controlled
substances after telehealth appointments, leading to the emergence of companies like Done, which, according to the
indictment, some customers described as a “straight up pill mill” and as a “scam to sell ADHD drugs and make a lot
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    
of fucking money.” Still, the direct relevance of this is also limited – I certainly wasn’t a customer of Done, and the
closing of this particular company doesn’t account for difficulties filling prescriptions among anyone seeing a legitimate
physician.
</p><!-- l. 105 --><p class='noindent'>However, the story of Done, Inc. is precisely that of which we’re supposed to be afraid. Are doctors pushing
stimulants to your kids? Are we seeing the beginning of a new prescription drug abuse epidemic? Are these
drugs falling into <span class='cmti-10x-x-109'>the wrong hands</span>? This is apparently the same fear driving the DEA to investigate
and forcibly close drug manufacturing plants – according to a story in <span class='cmti-10x-x-109'>New York </span>magazine by James
Walsh, the DEA’s “Operation Bottleneck,” ostensibly designed to curtail poor recordkeeping by these
manufacturers, is “a step towards redemption” for the same agency’s failures monitoring the manufacturers of
OxyContin.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#fn6x0' id='fn6x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>6</sup></a></span><a id='x1-12f6'></a>
The article profiles a particular manufacturer of stimulants and other drugs, Ascent Pharmaceuticals, which was
ordered by the DEA in 2023 to stop production entirely. Regardless of the quality of Ascent’s paperwork,
the fear is the same – the article quotes Joseph Rannazzisi, a former DEA official, who believes that
“everybody is concerned about the increase in use of stimulants” and their propensity to be addictive.
Walsh credulously repeats tales of “the cocainelike effect of stimulants,” implying their potential for
abuse, while quoting Keith Connors, a psychologist who developed an early ADHD test in the 1970s,
who apparently believes that doctors are “giving out …the medication at unprecedented and unjustified
levels.”
</p><!-- l. 107 --><p class='noindent'>Now, were this really the issue, it shouldn’t affect me, right? I’m special, one of the elect, deemed by psychologists and
psychiatrists to <span class='cmti-10x-x-109'>deserve </span>amphetamines – not like those imitators, customers of companies like Done, phonies who saw
an advetisement on TikTok and scammed their way into an Adderall prescription. The thing is, what Connors would
call a “justified” prescription, one the DOJ would call “medically necessary,” is an illusion. The DSM is not a manual
for medical care, it is a tool for governments and insurance companies to systematize and depersonalize that care.
Diagnosis is not a medical necessity but a capitalistic one, a means by which resources are diverted to those
who by some metric are entitled them, and, accordingly, away from those who don’t. And, for all their
fearmongering about a potential epidemic of stimulant addiction, regulatory agencies really only have this
one answer – to declare a select few deserving of care against a backdrop of nobody deserving care by
default.
</p><!-- l. 109 --><p class='noindent'>That version of the <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>Makefile </span>for this site is not the one I settled on – when it came to generating excerpts of posts for
the homepage, <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>sed </span>was just too impractical. The W3C (the people responsible for HTML standards and also
standards for kind of everything on the internet) publishes a tool called <span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>hxselect</span>, which can extract particular HTML
blocks from a page using CSS selectors. It’s only a small compromise – the tool has been around since at
the latest 2000, which for me may as well be the 1970s. And so, I’ve ended up with something barely
functional – a system that through its haphazard function embodies me and my own barely functional
self.
